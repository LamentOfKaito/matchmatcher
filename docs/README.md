# Thinking out loud

- [API Endpoints](./api-endpoints.md)

- [UI Design](./ui-design.md)

- [Implementation](./implementation.md)


## Considerations

- Player IDs are not consistent across different API holders.
    * [Player Universally Unique IDentifiers and a New Security Layer | Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en/DevRel/player-universally-unique-identifiers-and-a-new-security-layer)
    * [PUUIDs and Other IDs | Hextechdocs](https://hextechdocs.dev/puuids-and-other-ids/)

## Complaints

- Riot does not state whether a match is a remake, it assigns win or loss to every participant.
For example, OPGG reports that slog has 107 losses, while LeagueOfGraphs reports 108.
